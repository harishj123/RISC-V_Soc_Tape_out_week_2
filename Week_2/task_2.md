## üß™ Week 2 - Task 2: Pre-Synthesis Simulation of VSDBabySoC

### üëã Welcome to Task 2!

In this practical lab session, we simulate the `VSDBabySoC` design **before synthesis** using the open-source Verilog simulator **Icarus Verilog** and visualize the waveforms using **GTKWave**.

This task demonstrates how to:

* Compile a SystemVerilog testbench using `iverilog`
* Run the simulation using `vvp`
* View the output waveforms using `gtkwave`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Commands Used

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to project directory
cd ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC

# Step 2: Create output directory (if not already created)
mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim

# Step 3: Compile the testbench using Icarus Verilog
iverilog \
  -o output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out \
  -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM \
  -I src/include \
  -I src/module \
  src/module/testbench.v

# Step 4: Run the compiled simulation
vvp output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out

# Output:
# VCD info: dumpfile pre_synth_sim.vcd opened for output.
# testbench.v:63: $finish called at 84999000 (1ps)

# Step 5: View the waveform using GTKWave
gtkwave pre_synth_sim.vcd
```

### üìä Waveform Description

The generated waveform (`pre_synth_sim.vcd`) shows the behavior of the `vsdbabysoc_tb` testbench. Key signals observed:

* **ENb_CP**, **ENb_VCO**: Toggle between 0 and 1, enabling/disabling charge pump and VCO blocks.
* **REF**: A regular clock signal used as a reference input.
* **OUT**: Output signal from the SoC; toggles less frequently than REF.
* **reset**: Remains low, indicating the system is not under reset.
* **VREFH**: Holds steady at 3.3V.
* **VREFL**: Remains low or unused in this run.

This confirms the SoC's control and clock signals are functioning correctly under pre-synthesis simulation.
