# 🌟 Week 2: System on Chip (SoC) Design – Theory & Practical Exploration

Welcome to **Week 2** of the SoC design journey! This week, we dive deep into understanding the fundamentals of SoC architecture and put theory into practice with the **VSDBabySoC** project — a compact RISC-V based System on Chip.

---

## 📚 Task 1: SoC Design Fundamentals & Introduction to VSDBabySoC  
Explore the key concepts behind SoC technology, learn about VSDBabySoC’s architecture, components like the RVMYTH CPU, PLL, and DAC, and how they all work together to build a functioning SoC.

**➡️ [Read Task 1 Summary & Explanation](https://github.com/harishj123/RISC-V_Soc_Tape_out_week_2/blob/main/Week_2/task_1.md)**

## ⚙️ Task 2: Practical Simulation of VSDBabySoC SoC Design  
Get hands-on with the VSDBabySoC Verilog project! This task covers the project structure, module descriptions, and step-by-step instructions to run **pre-synthesis** simulation using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.
